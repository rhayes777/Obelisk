# Obelisk

Obelisk is a audio visual art installation produced for Shambala Festival by Cooper Studios and Tomlin Hayes Productions.

Two Arduinos are used to detect the range of nearby objects using ultrasonic range sensors. A python script takes the measured distance for each sensor and uses it to adjust the volume of part of a track as well as the brightness of a light.
